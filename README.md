## eCommerce Analytics and Optimisation Projects
This GitHub repository contains a collection of projects aimed at enhancing the performance of an eCommerce website using data from the Prism database. These projects provide insights and strategies to improve the website's conversion rates, implement tailored marketing approaches, optimize cross-selling and upselling techniques, and realign the existing loyalty program.

### Project 1: Conversion Rate Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing the website's conversion rates, particularly on mobile devices. Despite mobile accounting for 85% of visits, the conversion rate remains at 0.39%. Mobile navigation is successful, but a drop-off occurs when users attempt to add items to their cart. The project suggests conducting A/B tests to improve the basket and purchase process.

### Project 2: Tailored Marketing Strategies
In this project, marketing strategies are tailored for distinct customer segments. Champions, promising customers, and those needing attention are identified. Strategies to reward, encourage, and re-engage these segments are proposed, leveraging their buying behavior and preferences.

### Project 3: Conversion Rate Optimization
The Conversion Rate Optimization project examines the variations in conversion rates throughout the week, particularly the dip during weekends. The analysis reveals mobile users' reluctance in managing their baskets, resulting in lower add-to-cart rates. High cart abandonment rates also point to the need for refining the checkout process. Timing's impact on conversion rates is explored.

### Project 4: Cross-Selling and Upselling
This project delves into enhancing cross-selling and upselling efforts. The optimization of traffic sources to personalize recommendations is suggested. Additionally, bundling products based on common pairings and seasonal trends can potentially boost sales. The project highlights the potential for upselling by offering alternatives to popular items and proposing add-ons during the checkout process.

### Project 5: Re-aligning Loyalty Program
The final project centers on re-aligning the existing loyalty program, specifically focusing on Prism+ users. A substantial increase in transaction count is observed for Prism+ users compared to non-Prism+ users. Existing challenges in the loyalty program's tier system and incentives are addressed, and potential adjustments are proposed to enhance customer engagement and retention.
